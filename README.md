# Kotlin-Coroutines-Experiments

 Experiments on how to use Kotlin Coroutines in an Android appâ€”a new way of managing background threads that can 
 simplify code by reducing the need for callbacks. Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that convert async 
 callbacks for long-running tasks, such as database or network access, into sequential code.
 
 
 # Features
 
 - How to call code written with coroutines and obtain results.
 - How to use suspend functions to make async code sequential.
 - How to use launch and runBlocking to control how code executes.
 - Techniques to convert existing APIs to coroutines using suspendCoroutine.
 - How to use coroutines with Architecture Components.
 - Best practices for testing coroutines.
